# Requirements Gathering
During the first few weeks of work, we contacted and gathered requirements from our client, Bui Ngoc Le. The questions we asked the client to gather requirements included:
1. What is the process for handing over equipment to project teams for construction?

2. What is the process for receiving and returning system equipment?

3. How is equipment condition assessed?

4. What are the tasks and functions of each department? (For example, what does the IT department do?)

5. What happens if equipment reaches the end of its depreciation period? (Is it replaced, is it still in use...?)

## Requirements Analysis
**1. What is the process for handing over equipment to project teams for construction?**

- When executing the project, employees will contact the HR department to receive the assets they need. - When the equipment is handed over, the HR department will record in the system which employee received it.

- When the employee receives the equipment, they will confirm receipt in the system, and the handover is complete.

**2. How does the equipment receiving and returning process work?**

- Step 1: The employee who wants to return the equipment registers the handover in the system.

- Step 2: The HR department staff will check the asset, update the equipment status, and record it as handed over to the HR department for management.

- Step 3: After confirmation, the equipment has been returned to the HR department.

**3. How is the equipment's condition assessed?**

- The assessment is based on the recipient's opinion.

- For example: If the recipient finds the equipment unusable, the status will be updated to "Unusable".

**4. What are the tasks and functions of each department?**

- The five departments constitute the company's organizational structure.

- The system's operational procedures are already described.

**5. What happens if an asset or equipment reaches the end of its depreciation period?** (Is it replaced, or does it continue to be used...?)

- When purchased, the depreciation period for an asset is determined according to general regulations.

- If the asset has been used beyond that period, it is considered to have reached the end of its depreciation period. However, an asset that has reached the end of its depreciation period can still be used normally if it is still usable.

- The state of asset depreciation only has significance for calculating the asset's value for accounting purposes.
